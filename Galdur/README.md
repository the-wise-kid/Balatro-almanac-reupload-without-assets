# Galdur - An Enhanced Run Setup Tool
Galdur sets out to improve the usability of the run setup screen. Once you begin to add decks and stakes, the default selector quickly becomes arduous to navigate. Galdur dramatically improves this experience.

## The Deck Select Screen
See 12 decks at once, with a simple page system, to browse through your installed decks and select the one you want to play with.

The deck select screen includes a `Quick Start` button that will start a game with your last selected combination of deck and stake to skip the future screens.

## The Stake Select Screen
A similar screen awaits you when selecting a stake. In addition to improving the usability of setting up a run, Galdur also enables a non-linear stake progression, and displays unlock conditions for future stakes.

Galdur offers customisation out of the box. If you have any additional config options you would like adding, let me know.
