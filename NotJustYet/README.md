# NotJustYet
**(Steamodded 1.0)** Prevents scoring from ending the round early

# Info

This mod contains a slightly customisable **keybind** and **colour**. To change them, you can open the mod's **main.lua** and edit the variables directly. They are defaulted to '**lshift**' and '**GREEN**'

Holding the keybind while scoring a winning hand will mimic vanilla behaviour, useful in cases where you want to avoid drawing more cards

When [Handy](https://github.com/SleepyG11/HandyBalatro) is installed, the keybind is hard-set to '**enter**'
